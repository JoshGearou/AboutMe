    <string name="bio">Hello, my name is Josh Gearou.  I am a recent graduate of Pomona College working
                       for a large company called Verizon Media Group.  I am an associate software
                       developer for the company.  Some of my hobbies include: playing tennis, guitar, saxophone
                       piano, singing, and coding of course.  I also really enjoy reading fantasy books.
                       my favorite fantasy author currently is Brandon Sanderson.  I also enjoy listening to music.
                       My favorite singer is Tori Kelly.  \n\t\t\t\tMy next endeavor has been writing music.  In my last semester of college, I took a course
                       called Music Theory I.  I learned a lot about writing music in the course and had
                       a lot of fun doing it along the way.  Since then, I have continued to compose and
                       practice composing in my spare time.  I couple this with online tutorials about
                       music theory as well.
